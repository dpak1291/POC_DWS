# POC_DWS Enchancements
* Add Transaction History feature for capturing Credits/Debits across one/all account's
* Deposit and withdraw features would be nice to increase/decrease balance in existing account which are stored
* In distributed systems environment we can integrate persistence layer with any supported Database  - (enabling commit/rollback operations during transaction's sucess/failure)
